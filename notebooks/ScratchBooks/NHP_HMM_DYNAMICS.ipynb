    "# The gamut:\n",
    "we want to define motifs as different control strategies over an implicit control system, the joystick monkey, that would decay in motion without external input. In terms of a discrete system, $x_{t}=Ax_{t-1} +\\tau \\dot{x}_{t-1}$ for $\\dot{x}_{t-1}=0$ will go to $\\rightarrow$ $x_{t}-Ax_{t-1} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, any changes to a stable system not related to implicit dynamics must come from the control matrix. In Pac-man, for example, it represents an input matrix perturbation to those implicit dynamics $A+B$\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios of control over linear dynamics, the linear dynamics of an inherent system to be controlled may not change.\n",
    "For example, for a velocity control system, we can write a discrete state space model with transition matrix $A$ as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple 1D system, the state variables are the: position $x$ and velocity $\\dot{x}$\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that the force moving the system F= $\\ddot{x} \\rightarrow$ goes to a spring deviation term of $(x - target)$ and this is absorbed into $Bu$\n",
    "Therefore, force == acceleration == B(x-target) for a proportional controller. Therefore, fitting a model to different control scenarios surmounts to fixing the system dynamics $A$ and allowing deviations to emerge for how controls $Bu$ are applied for a given target.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: in the multi-target case for above, differentiation of motifs is pushed into the control matrix and the $B$ matrix will have multiple columns, n columns for n targets, to be exact. However, residual control states could be added in. Residual control states could relate to, say, cost functions on the environment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: having a fixed systems dynamics $A$ works when the state variable is the position/velocity of the cursor. However, this changes in egocentric coordinates, but still can be written out appropriately as I show next. In the next egocentric variant, we can write out multiple states that reference the deviation from each target and is larger for obvious reasons when we consider the input of multiple targets.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Note 2: however, this model doesn't really conform to expectations. Unless we write the control u as the sum of target acceleration at t-1 +/- the proportional error term for the joystick and target. Or wait, is it just relative acceleration?? Or due to the +\\- properties, can we write/decompose the $Bu$ as $\\ddot{x}_{target} - u$\n",
    "Where $u = (x-x_1)_{t-1}$\n",
    "This means that $\\ddot{x}_{target}$ could be effectively moved into the A matrix, as there is no control over and added to the state matrix $\\vec{x}$ and would expand the rows and columns of $A$ by 1 for 1 target and by 2 or n-rows and n-columns for n targets\n",
