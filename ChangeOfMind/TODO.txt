Behavior:
1. Capture rate and Timing by delta value
2. Do delta_wt on other variables.
3. Control model of delta_wt
4. Supp plots showing minimal correlation


Behavioral

Neural_GLM

2. clustering
3. NNMF and one to one match
4.  Single trial: decoder

Demixed_PCA:
1. neuron contribution from participation ratio of weights
2. Single variable correlations
3. If tempted, LDS on same session data

Evidence Accumulate

Neural Theory plots:
Tesselation of space or discretized attractors
