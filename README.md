Models to implement:

HMM IO GLM: for example, if units are good for prediction, do they continue to predict or something more flexible?
Like place fields but not.



Cluster these things based on given time-windows.  How to choose dt, will save for later.
#discern going and resting by velocity thresholds....
Do DMD first on long sets of data 1st.


TODO In order:
1. finish wasserstein distance metric and normalization and averaging
2. Finish binning and threshold relabeling
3.
